Soil Moisture Monitor

An Arduino-based soil moisture monitor using a capacitive sensor and LED indicators (red, yellow, green) to visually represent soil health. Designed for plant care and DIY electronics learning.

Features

- Real-time moisture readings using capacitive soil sensor
- ðŸ”´ðŸŸ¡ðŸŸ¢ LED indicators for dry, borderline, and well-watered conditions
- Calibrated analog threshold logic
- Breadboard-based prototype (3D-printable case optional)

Components Used

- Arduino Uno (REXQualis)
- Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor v1.2
- Red, Yellow, and Green LEDs
- 220Î© resistors (3x)
- Jumper wires & breadboard
